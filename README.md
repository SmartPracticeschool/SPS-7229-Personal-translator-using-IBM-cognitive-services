Personal translator using IBM cognitive services
Submitted in partial requirement for 
IBM Gurucool

Overview
Imagine when you want to communicate with someone from a different country, you have to hire someone that can speak both languages and do all the translating. That was the case in old times, but after the development of the internet and technology, communication has become much and much easier. Now, we can use IBM cognitive services to translate anything we want in a couple of seconds. Machine Translation (MT) is the task of automatically converting one natural language into another, preserving the meaning of the input text, and producing fluent text in the output language. While machine translation is one of the oldest subfields of artificial intelligence research, the recent shift towards large-scale empirical techniques has led to very significant improvements in translation quality[1].

Purpose
The purpose of this project is to create a web app and personal telegram bot that can be your personal translator. The app uses IBM Watson Speech to Text, Watson Language Translator, and Watson Text to Speech services to transcribe, translate, and synthesize from your microphone to your headphones. Services used in this project include IBM Language Translator, IBM Text to Speech, IBM Speech to Text, IBM Language Identification and Node-RED. As for all languages translation from one language to another is not supported by the services the web app and telegram bot is limited to specific languages for translation.
